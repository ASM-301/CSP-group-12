Vehicle Routing Problem
Assignment 1
Group 12
-	Variables:
•	Vehicle routes that consist of a sequence of nodes (Customers or depots)
•	The Decision variables represents the sequence of visits for each Variable

-	Domain:
•	The possible routes of each vehicle that consists of all permutations of customer nodes that respect the vehicle’s capacity and cost window constraints

-	Constraints: 
•	Capacity constraint*
•	Cost constraint*
•	Routing constraint: Each customer must be visited exactly once by one vehicle
•	Depot constraint: each route must start and end at the same depot.

-	Objective:
Our objective is to minimize the total distance travelled and the cost
